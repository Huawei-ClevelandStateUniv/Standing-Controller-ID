# Standing-Controller-ID
Controller Idenfication of Healthy Human Standing Balance

The paper of controller identificaiton of standing balance will include both experiment data and controller identification reuslts. It will be a complete researc paper which give several conclusions in engineering side of healthy human standing balance.

## Research Questions:
Based on the work we did and going to do, potential research questions could be:

1. Will quiet standing controller changing after experiencing perturbation?
2. Will people use different standign balance controller at different time? (optinal)
4. Which controllers are healthy people using in quiet standing and under random perturbation?


## Statement of significance

1. New experiment data of quiet standing and standing balance under random perturbation. Quiet standing was recorded before and after long duration random perturbation.
2. Identify controller from experiment data in time domain under random perturbation
3. The identified controller is engineering applicable.
4. Long duration experiment data identification in time domain.


## Experiment

* 6~8 subjects
* Each subject needs come to the lab at 2 different days to particpate the same experiment. This is to check whether their response are consistency. (optional)
* 27 marker set and 10 EMG sensors were used to record data.
* Five 5 mins trials were applied to each subject in each day's experiment. Here are the general experiemnt schedual:
  * Subject come; Introduce lab equipments and experiment information. Read and sign consent form. (5~10 mins)
  * Attach Markers and EMG sensors. (30~40 mins)
  * Set up Mocap template, be ready of recording. (5~10 mins)
  * 5 mins quiet standing trial. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins random perturbation trial. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins quiet standing. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins random perturbation trial again. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins rest. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins quiet standing. (5mins)
  
* Total experiment time: 70 mins to 90 mins

* Gaussian Perturbation was chosen as random perturbation. Because of the motor issue in treadmill, The motion which absolute value of velocity less than 0.05 m/s was removed.



## Controller Idenitification

* Controller Identifications with noise model were applied on quiet standing data
  * Controller type should be carefully selected
* Controller Identifications with noise model were applied on perturbed standing data
  * Controller type should be carefully selected

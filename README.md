Controller Idenfication of Healthy Human Standing Balance

 This paper will include both experiment data and controller identification reuslts. 

## Research Questions:
Based on the work we did and going to do, potential research questions could be:

1. Will quiet standing controller changing after experiencing perturbation?
2. Will people use different standign balance controller at different time? (optional)
4. Which controllers are healthy human using in quiet standing
4. Which controllers are healthy human using under random perturbation?


## Statement of significance

1. New experiment data of quiet standing and standing balance under random perturbation. Quiet standing data is recorded before and after long duration random perturbation.
2. Identify controller from experiment data in time domain under random perturbation
3. The identified controller is engineering applicable.


## Experiment

* 6~8 subjects
* Each subject needs come to the lab at 2 different days to particpate the same experiment. This is to check whether their responses are consistency. (optional)
* 27 marker set and 10 EMG sensors were used to record data.
* Five 5 mins trials were applied to each subject in each day's experiment. Here are the general experiemnt schedule:
  * Subject come; Introduce lab equipments and experiment information. Read and sign consent form. (5~10 mins)
  * Attach Markers and EMG sensors. (30~40 mins)
  * Set up Mocap template, be ready of recording. (5~10 mins)
  * 5 mins quiet standing trial. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins random perturbation trial. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins quiet standing. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins random perturbation trial again. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins rest. (5 mins)
  * 5 mins quiet standing. (5mins)
  
* Total experiment time: 70 mins to 90 mins

* Gaussian Perturbation was used as random perturbation. Because of the motor issue in treadmill, the motion period which absolute value of velocity less than 0.05 m/s was set to constant position.



## Controller Idenitification

* Controller Identifications with noise model were applied on quiet standing data
  * Controller type should be carefully selected
* Controller Identifications with noise model were applied on perturbed standing data
  * Controller type should be carefully selected
